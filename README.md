# Angular Challenge

Welcome to the frontend repository of our ionic web application!

## Project Overview

Create a new project using the Ionic Framework and Angular.
The project should include two pages that use UI components from https://ionicframework.com/docs/components
The first page should display a login form with options for logging in using a username and a password. Clicking the login button should redirect the user to the second page.
The second page should display a list of items retrieved from a Firebase Cloud Firestore database. The component should allow the user to filter the items by category and/or price range.
Use Ionic components to implement the interface.
The website should be responsive, meaning that the pages should look good on both mobile and desktop resolutions.
## Getting Started

To set up and run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install project dependencies using npm install or yarn install.
3. Run the development server using npm run start or yarn dev.
5. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:4200.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

Our frontend is powered by cutting-edge technologies and libraries, including:

- Angular 17: Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- Ionic: Empowering seamless cross-platform development, Ionic brings a comprehensive suite of UI components and tools for building robust, high-performance applications.
- Material UI: Providing beautiful and customizable UI components.
- Typescript: Allowing you to write more maintainable and scalable code by catching errors at compile time.
